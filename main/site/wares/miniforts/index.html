<h2 id="a-game-about-building-and-defending-a-fort">A game about building and defending a fort.</h2>
<p>In 2021, I started making a small base-builder RTS game. It runs on the <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Minetest</strong></a> voxel game engine.</p>
<project-info-card><strong>Project details</strong><a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/mini_forts" target="_blank">View source</a><dl><dt>status</dt><dd>unreleased</dd><dt>role</dt><dd>creator</dd><dt>platform</dt><dd>Minetest</dd><dt>tech</dt><dd>Lua, JSX</dd></dl></project-info-card>

<p>The goal of this game is to defend a central core from invaders. The player commands minions to build up a fort around the core.</p>

<p>Minions are indirectly commanded by putting construction orders in the world.</p>
<img alt="gif" src="media/miniforts_2.gif" loading="lazy" width="640" height="354" style="--lqip:-169308"></img>

<p>It has some rudimentary physics, where structures disconnected from the ground get destroyed.</p>
<img alt="gif" src="media/miniforts_3.gif" loading="lazy" width="640" height="354" style="--lqip:-174364"></img>

<p>The game is not <em>complete</em>, but it’s decent enough for a few minutes of gameplay.</p>

<p>The game’s development slowed down as I found myself being limited with Minetest’s API and engine - particularly its client-server limitations. I guess it’s because Minetest is a first-person creative-survival voxel game &quot;engine&quot; - a Minecraft clone, if you will. It’s not particularly suited for a base-builder RTS experience.</p>
<p>Here, I’ll write about some of the major and minor limitations and the solutions I came up with.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-scripting-language">The scripting language</h2>
<p>Minetest uses <strong>Lua</strong> as its scripting language, which I found limited for the scale of the project. For MiniForts, I needed strong-typing, advanced OOP, and some scalable UI DSL.</p>
<p>So MiniForts was written in <strong>TypeScript</strong>. I used <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/" target="_blank"><strong>TypeScriptToLua</strong></a> to convert it to Lua that the game understands.</p>
<p>With the addition of custom <code>.d.ts</code> declaration files, I was able to use Minetest’s API in a type-safe way. TypeScript also unlocked fancy OOP, very useful in developing a game, and JSX! More on JSX in the following section.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-gui-engine">The GUI engine</h2>
<p>One major problem was Minetest’s <strong>GUI system</strong>. It uses a procedural GUI model, where interactions and UI updates are procedural, as opposed to the modern declarative UI model. Furthermore, it uses absolute positioning and has a lack of nesting or layouting.</p>
<p>To solve this I used <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html" target="_blank"><strong>JSX</strong></a>, an XML-like syntax for defining UI in code.</p>
<p>But Minetest is not a web browser. There isn’t anything in Minetest that knows how to render JSX elements. I had to create a <strong>GUI engine</strong> within the game that takes in JSX elements and renders it via Minetest’s APIs and that also works with the server-driven UI system that Minetest has.</p>
<p>The end-result was a more flexible GUI system, with bonus reactive data-binding and callbacks.</p>

        </td>
      </table>

<p>Here’s an example layout which is the HUD that shows the player’s current resources in the upper-right corner of the screen:</p>

<img alt="hud code" src="media/miniforts_hud_code.png" loading="lazy" width="1160" height="796"></img>

<p>It was pretty interesting to recreate a React-like environment on top of a very limited GUI API.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pathfinding">Pathfinding</h2>
<p>Minetest has a built-in ground-based A* pathfinding algorithm, implemented in C++, exposed via the Lua API.</p>
<p>I’ve found that the built-in pathfinder wasn’t sufficient for this game. This game has multiple agents with different locomotion types, a complex 3D terrain, and destructible walls.</p>
<p>I ended up implementing a hierarchical pathfinding algorithm with a structure similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBQn_sg7DA" target="_blank"><strong>RimWorld</strong>’s region system</a>, also inspired by <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025151/Hierarchical-Dynamic-Pathfinding-for-Large" target="_blank"><strong>Castle Story</strong>’s pathfinder</a>.</p>

<p>The system divides the world into <em>components</em>, each of which is a volume that contains a set of positions reachable from one another.</p>

<p>The pathfinder then finds a path through the component-level first, which is very fast, and only resolving voxel-level paths when the agent is trying to move within a component.</p>

<h2 id="world-generation">World generation</h2>
<p>At the time, I was only able to create one world type - the Forest.</p>
<img alt="forest" src="media/miniforts_forest0.png" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1387" style="--lqip:-158246"></img>

<p>The terrain is a combination of stepped gradient noise maps generated from Minetest’s Perlin noise generator.</p>
<p>The trees are positioned by placing points in a 2D grid and randomizing their locations within their grid cell.</p>
<img alt="forest" src="media/miniforts_forest1.png" loading="lazy" width="1334" height="680" style="--lqip:236138"></img>

<p>The roots are generated from the difference of two gradient noise maps, creating these snaking patterns, with height falloff based on the nearest tree.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-art">The art</h2>
<p>I like pixel art. It’s easy to make passable results.</p>
<figure><prose-bleed><img alt="art collection" src="media/miniforts_art.png" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" style="--lqip:174819"></img></prose-bleed><figcaption>See also, botom right corner, unfinished enemy type: the Dung Beetle. It would place blocks of dirt against your fort walls which would allow other enemies to climb over!</figcaption></figure>

<p>I struggled with the ground textures a lot. I realized that what’s more important at this resolution is the readability of something rather than the details of it.</p>
<prose-bleed><img alt="grass comparison" src="media/miniforts_grass.gif" loading="lazy" width="1078" height="680" style="--lqip:-174620"></img></prose-bleed>

<p>A lot of inspiration was drawn from <strong>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</strong>, which had similar miniature environments.</p>

<h2 id="autotile">Autotile</h2>
<p>Autotiling is a system that selects the correct node to use based on whether it’s a corner block, edge, etc. The autotile system in MiniForts works in 3D. The benefits are visual: less blocky blocks, and more cohesive structures.</p>

<p>In the end, I was not able to publish this game to the game community because I felt like it was still incomplete in terms of features. The base game and systems were pretty good though. Anyway, it was still a fun project and a good nourishment for my game development hobby.</p>
