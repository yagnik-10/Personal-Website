<p><strong>Hypertangram</strong> (2018) is a mind-bending geometric puzzle game on Android based on the classic tangram puzzle. What’s different with this one is that, in addition to regular dragging and rotating, <em>pieces can be resized</em>.</p>

<p>The resizing mechanic adds a lot of state space to an otherwise regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle" target="_blank">dissection puzzle</a>.</p>
<p>The idea had been sitting in the back of my mind for quite a time, and I finally did it in about 6 months of development in my free time.</p>

<p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing. There were lots of problems with the geometry code.</p>
<p>See, I didn’t want grid-based movement like in other tangram apps. I wanted free dragging, rotation, and scaling, with smart edge-snapping.</p>
<p>This design decision proved to be technically demanding later on.</p>

<p>But that’s not all. There were more <em>geometrials</em> ahead. Due to the nature of the main game mechanic, there can be several solutions to a single puzzle.</p>

<p>There is no easy way to find them all by hand, nor by algorithm, as far as I know. The solution checking algorithm went through rounds of rethinking.</p>
<p>I ended up with an algorithmic approach, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_operations_on_polygons" target="_blank">boolean operations on polygons</a>, in order to implement the win condition.</p>
<p><em>Note to self: Don’t mix geometric operations and floating point numbers. They are oil and water.</em></p>
<p>Other notable features include the smart edge-snapping (there is no grid, and no predetermined solution), and an accessible single-finger mode for resizing and rotating pieces without the need for a second finger.</p>

<p>Aside from design &amp; programming, I also created the music and graphics myself. For the look, I wanted it minimal with a physical feel. Abstract, yet tangible.</p>
<p>The game’s graphics are procedurally rendered using Android’s <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas" target="_blank"><code>Canvas</code></a> API.</p>

<p>I really liked what I did here. Of course, there’s always room for improvement, but finished is better than perfect.</p>
<p>This was my first “complete” game in terms of features and polish.</p>
<p><em>It was a <strong>geometriumph</strong>.</em></p>
<box-note>Update: It has been taken down from Google Play Store by Google due to “inactivity”. :/</box-note>
