<h2 id="part-1-generative-art">Part 1. Generative art</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art" target="_blank"><strong>Generative art</strong></a> is a kind of art where a set of rules creates the artwork, instead of the artist rendering it manually.</p>
<p>These rules are usually in the form of computer programs written by the artist.</p>
<p>Since I know more about coding than actual artistic skills, this is exactly the right stuff for this project.</p>

  <figcaption>Example of generative art</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the simpler kinds of generative art revolves around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation" target="_blank"><strong>tessellations</strong></a> or tilings.</p>
<p>The main idea was that the whole image would be a random arrangement of square tiles. The tiles would be laid out side-by-side with no overlaps nor gaps. The resulting geometric pattern itself would be the source of aesthetic value.</p>
<p>I wanted to symbolize <em>Creativity</em>, one of the event’s themes. Creative tools and instruments served as inspiration for the tiles’ appearances.</p>
<img alt="notes for the second attempt" src="../media/dimensions_notes1.jpg" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="700" style="--lqip:174819"></img>

<p>Pen, paper, pencil, brush, and tablet: these would become the building blocks of the piece.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_notes2.jpg" loading="lazy" width="814" height="813" style="--lqip:108259"></img><figcaption>Testing some random tiling</figcaption></figure>

<p>In designing the individual tiles I restricted them to one basic shape — a quarter circle — as basis for the tiles’ forms.</p>

<p>The point of limiting to one basic shape was to create unity across the whole piece and mitigate chaos from the randomness of the algorithm.</p>

<p>The tiles’ curves should seamlessly connect with neighboring tiles, forming more complex shapes like semicircles and S-curves.</p>
<p>After some more doodling around, it was time to code!</p>

<h2 id="rendering-the-image">Rendering the image</h2>
<p>The image generator was implemented in JavaScript with <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Vue.js</strong></a>. The individual shapes themselves were implemented using CSS (lots of <code>border-radius</code>!).</p>
<p>The image generation process worked along these lines:</p>
<p>Make a 9in&nbsp;×&nbsp;12in board, subdivided into a 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 grid of tiles.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_grid.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600" height="800" style="--lqip:-174621"></img><figcaption>.board &#123; display: grid &#125;</figcaption></figure>

<p><small class="small-block">That day I learned that CSS inches don’t actually match physical inches on a computer screen.</small></p>
<p>For each cell, randomly render any of the five tile types:</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_1tiles.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" style="--lqip:-174669"></img><figcaption>Random tiles added with placeholder colors. Board truncated to a square here for brevity.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Each tile is randomly rotated in 90-degree increments, or flipped horizontally or vertically.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_2tiles.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" style="--lqip:-88479"></img><figcaption>Tiles randomly oriented</figcaption></figure>

<p>You may start seeing some semicircles and larger contours forming across tiles.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_tileedges.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" style="--lqip:-174557"></img><figcaption>Contours highlighted via edge detector. The effect actually looks cool though. This could’ve been an entirely different direction for the piece!</figcaption></figure>

<p>See those other shapes <em>emerging</em> from the five basic tiles? If you squint hard enough, you might be able to see a Pacman, maybe an apple logo, or maybe a bird.</p>
<p><em>Emergence</em> is a common feature of generative art. It’s the idea that something more arises from simple systems — whether intentional or coincidental. A good example of emergence is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_art" target="_blank">fractal art</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step was to pick a palette from a color scheme generator <small>(because everything’s generated!)</small>, and randomly assign each region a color.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_coloring.jpg" loading="lazy" width="200" height="200" style="--lqip:108259"></img><figcaption>Each tile colored randomly</figcaption></figure>

<p>Random noise textures were overlayed as well. The textures were generated solely using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>’s noise generators and filters. <small>Could’ve implemented a live texture generator into the renderer, but time was limited.</small></p>
<p>The result of all the rules above was this:</p>
<figure><prose-bleed><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_tfull.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600" height="800" style="--lqip:174747"></img></prose-bleed><figcaption>First decent result</figcaption></figure>

<p>I was pretty happy with the results so far. This one could probably pass as MVP.</p>
<p>However, it was kinda monotonous. There was a lack of structure or composition in the image.</p>
<p>This is the downside of tile-based algorithms. But nothing that can’t be fixed!</p>
<p>I added big off-grid circles, which manifested as different color schemes for intersecting tiles.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="../media/dimensions_tcircle2.jpg" loading="lazy" width="600" height="800" style="--lqip:-92701"></img><figcaption>Circle intersections added</figcaption></figure>

<p>It got contrasting regions, which should improve composition. Points of interest also emerged from the intersections between edges, and it broke the monotony of the grid.</p>
<p>I implemented this effect by overlaying multiple copies of the board, each copy having a different palette. Then on each copy I applied circular clipping masks (CSS <code>clip-path</code>) that correspond to regions in the image.</p>
<p>Next tweak was on color selection. I changed the selection from a uniform random distribution to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank">normal distribution</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of having equal chances for each color to be picked, colors in the middle of the palette got higher chances of getting picked than those near the ends.</p>

<p>This made some colors more prominent than others, building a hierarchy of colors that produced a less chaotic image.</p>

<p>The image generation algorithm evolved a little more before reaching the final form.</p>

<p>Generative art is fun! It’s experimental, explorative, and iterative!</p>
<p>Going back to the exhibit: each participant can submit a maximum of six pieces. So far I’ve got one. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I could just generate more pieces to submit if I wanted!</p>
<p>So I randomized the parameters, generated hundreds of instances, and picked some of the good ones.</p>
<img alt="set of random renders" src="../media/dimensions_renders.png" loading="lazy" width="1100" height="444" style="--lqip:174819"></img>

<p>I could’ve randomized the palette each time too, but color is tricky and best left to human eyes.</p>
<p>All that’s left was adding the QR code that would link to the augmented reality app.</p>
<p>The QR code would connect the physical and the virtual components, making it a seamless single experience.</p>
<p>Adding the QR code involved changing the center tiles to a lighter palette before adding in the code, ensuring that the code will be readable in every randomly-generated instance of the piece.</p>

<p>And that’s it for the physical prints! The next part is about the non-physical half of the piece, the augmented reality component.</p>

<p>This is a post-exhibit version, where I finally figured out color palette generation, and made the tiles recursive.</p>
