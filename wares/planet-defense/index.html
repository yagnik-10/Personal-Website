<p>Ludum Dare is a Game Jam (a hackathon for games) held every four months. A theme is announced and participants create a game from scratch in <em>48 hours</em>.</p>
<p>I used to participate in these <abbr title="Ludum Dare">LD</abbr>jams frequently. In LD 38, the theme was <strong>A Small World</strong>. Immediately after the theme was announced, I went self-brainstorming for game concepts. Fortunately, I settled on an idea before the 12-hour mark.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command" target="_blank">Missile Command</a> was an arcade game from the ’80s. The usual formula of taking a classic and giving it a twist was not very original, but time was limited. Minus points for Innovation, I guess.</p>

<p>Several hours later, I managed to come up with a working game/prototype.</p>

<p>Hooray! A finished game in exchange for precious hours of sleep!</p>
<p>The game was made with <a href="http://www.pixijs.com" target="_blank">PixiJS</a>, a scene-graph based 2D graphics engine for JavaScript. I’m used to this graphics model since I started programming with Flash.</p>
<p>I initially tried <a href="https://phaser.io" target="_blank">Phaser</a>, but it was too much for my taste. Having found out that Phaser uses Pixi underneath, I went with Pixi. I prefer the simple libraries.</p>
<p>Overall it was an OK game. I think a mobile port would be appropriate, given the simple gameplay and controls.</p>

<p>This game’s source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/PlanetDefense" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Not the prettiest code. It’s a hackathon!</p>
<p>You can play it standalone <a href="https://kalabasa.github.io/PlanetDefense" target="_blank">here</a>. Contest entry page <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/planet-defense-1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
