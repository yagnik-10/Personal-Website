<h2 id="edit-photos-online">Edit photos online</h2>
<p><strong>Photo Editor</strong> (2019) was an online tool offered by <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Ð¡Ð°nvÐ°</a> for simple image editing. It had filters, sliders, and crop, resize, and rotation tools.</p>
<p>Note that itâ€™s distinct from the Ð¡Ð°nvÐ° design app. This was more of a standalone tool for quick edits, with an ulterior purpose of marketing the primary Ð¡Ð°nvÐ° app.</p>
<p><box-note><strong>Update:</strong> The standalone app has been decommissioned, and photo editing features are now part of the main app.</box-note></p>

<p>In the beginnng, the Photo Editor was a tool made by a third party developer in a proprietary UI framework on top of Angular 1 and Node 5.</p>
<p>This version was very old and tbh a bit difficult to maintain and iterate on. It was also not responsive so mobile users were missing out.</p>

<p>So a redesign was made and the app was rewritten in a more modern stack. The new version looks better, modern, and is responsive.</p>
<p>My part in this redesign was coding the webapp and the welcome page.</p>

<p>I wrote the new app in <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank"><strong>React</strong></a> with <a href="https://mobx.js.org/" target="_blank"><strong>MobX</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There were a few WebGL and canvas filter algorithms from the old app that I reimplemented. Had to dip my toes into some fragment shaders for the WebGL version.</p>

<p>The backend is a simple server written with <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Express</strong></a> and the whole app was deployed on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Heroku</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After the launch we saw doubling in signups! ðŸ”¥ It was a fun project.</p>
